# Overview
This is my version of the original gilded rose kata available [here](https://github.com/emilybache). I have kept the original item class but created classes on top of the original item class.

## Development
I used the following tools during the development process.

- Python 3.8.5 (PyEnv)
- Venv (Poetry)
- Linter (Flake8)
- Type checker (Mypy)
- Code formatting (Black)
- Testing (Pytest)
- pre-commit hook (linting, code format, tests)
